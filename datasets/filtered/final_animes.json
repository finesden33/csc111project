What's more, Manabe isn't driven away by Kotoura seeing his thoughts, and even goes out of his way to befriend her - seemingly because he enjoys thinking of the girl erotically and seeing her subsequent embarrassment! Before long, the once-lonely girl even meets other students who aren't pushed away by her abilities. Could this be the start of a normal school life, with real, lasting friends for Kotoura?\"",
